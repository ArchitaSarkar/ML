    "The video introduces mathematical transformations in feature engineering, which involve applying mathematical formulas to data columns to transform them. The main goal of these transformations is to convert data distribution into a normal distribution, as some machine learning algorithms (like linear regression and logistic regression) perform better with normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video outlines several types of transformations, including log transform, reciprocal transform, and power transform (which encompasses square and square root transforms). More complex transformations like Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson are mentioned as future topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presenter then discusses Function Transformer, a tool within the scikit-learn library. It's one of three mathematical transformers available and is the focus of this video. Function Transformer can be used for log transform, reciprocal transform, square and square root transforms, and even for creating custom functions.\n",

    "The presenter covers several methods to check normality: plotting the distribution using seaborn.histplot for visual assessment, using pandas.DataFrame.skew() for a numerical measure of skewness, and importantly, using QQ Plots. QQ plots are highlighted as the most reliable method, where data points closely following a 45-degree line indicate normal distribution, while deviations suggest skewness or other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video then explains the log transform in detail. This transform involves taking the logarithm of each data point. It's primarily used for right-skewed data and cannot be applied to negative values. Log transformation helps compress large values, bringing them closer together on a linear scale, which in turn improves the performance of linear models."
