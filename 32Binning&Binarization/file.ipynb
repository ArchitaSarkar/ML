    "1. Encoding Numerical Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Convert continuous numbers into categories.\n",
    "Example: Grouping Google Play app downloads (e.g., \"1M+ downloads\") to simplify analysis and improve model results.\n",

    "2. Discretization (Binning): Dividing data into intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal Width/Uniform Binning:\n",
    "Concept: Bins have the same range size.\n",
    "Example: 'Age' column, creating bins like 0-10, 10-20, etc. (similar to a histogram).\n",
    "Equal Frequency/Quantile Binning:\n",
    "Concept: Each bin contains an equal number of data points.\n",
    "Example: 'Age' column, where each bin holds 10% of the population, even if the age range for each bin varies (e.g., 0-16 for the first 10%).\n",
    "KMeans Binning:\n",
    "Concept: Uses KMeans clustering to form bins, good for naturally clustered data.\n",
    "Custom/Domain-based Binning:\n",
    "Concept: Bins created based on specific knowledge.\n",
    "Example: 'Age' column, creating bins like \"0-18 (Child),\" \"18-60 (Adult),\" \"60+ (Retired).\"\n",
    "3. Binarization: Special case of discretization, converting values to 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: Converts continuous values to binary based on a threshold.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "'Annual Income': < 6 lakh = 0 (non-taxable), > 6 lakh = 1 (taxable).\n",
    "'Image Processing': Pixel values below threshold = 0 (black), above = 1 (white).\n",
    "The video uses the Titanic dataset to demonstrate these concepts with code."
